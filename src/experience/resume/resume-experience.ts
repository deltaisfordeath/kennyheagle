        venue: 'ADVANCED GLAZING SOLUTIONS',
        description: 'This role involved total ownership of a wide variety of responsibilities ranging from architecting information systems to allow multiple users to have real-time access to company software and data, maintaining and validating accounting records, obtaining business licenses and certifications, and ensuring compliance with labor laws, to name just a few.\n\nAccordingly, this role required a self-starting attitude, strong attention to detail, and effective time management/prioritization. Additionally, this role required excellent communication skills as I had to coordinate between numerous parties inside and outside the company to ensure deadlines were met. When issues arose I took responsibility and communicated to stakeholders the circumstances and remediation steps that would be taken to resolve the matter.\n\nMy proudest accomplishment in this role was using Python scripts and Excel macros to automate several time wasting processes for the estimating/sales team, monthly billings, and release of lien rights, resulting in the company increasing revenues 288% year-over-year without having to increase headcount.'
