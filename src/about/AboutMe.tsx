            I&apos;ve been fascinated with electronics since the first time my dad brought home a desktop computer when I was a child. The computer ran on MS-DOS, couldn’t connect to the internet or play videos, or do anything else that should have caught the attention of a five year old boy. Yet somehow that machine drew me in; it had an inexplicable, monumental presence about it. That impression has stuck with me my entire life.

        <div className="about-me-section">By the time I was 12 I managed to get my hands on all the parts needed to build my own desktop. I had a copy of Windows 98 ready to go, but it turned out merely assembling the machine was the easy part. We had internet access by this point, but the internet back then was disorganized and hard to navigate. There was no YouTube to look up simple tutorials. I had to read through the owner’s manual of my motherboard to learn about setting the boot order in BIOS and using the jumper pins on the hard drive and CD-ROM to designate primary and secondary devices.</div>
        <div className="about-me-section">Finally getting that computer to boot into Windows 98 turned out to be a long, long process with many breakthroughs and setbacks. But I was determined, or perhaps obsessed, and I never saw failure as an option. This drive has persisted in me through adulthood.</div>
        <div className="about-me-section">The internet has come a long way from those days of 56k dial-up, America Online free trial CDs, and highly ineffective search engines. Yet the potential of the internet is still barely being realized.I&apos;m very excited to see how technologies like blockchain, generative AI, and web assembly will shape the future. I will work hard to contribute as much as I can to bringing about the next generation of web services.</div>
